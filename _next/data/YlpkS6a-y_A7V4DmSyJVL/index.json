Alpine.js is a tiny JavaScript framework that makes declarative rendering super easy, without the weight of larger frameworks like Vue or React.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a full featured javascript framework with routing, state management, and a bit more complexity. Then, Vue or React may be a better fit.</p>\n<p>Instead, if you&#8217;re looking to a little javascript, add two-way data binding, and create simple components in your web pages.<br />\nThen, AlpineJS is the library you will want to reach for, which fits simple and better way of handling js in modern way.<br />\nIt puts simplicty back into javascript.</p>\n<p>Creator Caleb Porzio (Creator of Alpine.js, Laravel Livewire) has kept much of the syntax is like Vue.js,</p>\n<p>Probably the most attractive things about Alpine for me is its syntax, if you already know Vue, you basically know Alpine,</p>\n<p>Alpine is designed to be used with a CDN script, rather than any complex Webpack setup, so all we need is a single HTML file with the script pulled in in the head.</p>\n<p><em>Check the Alpine GitHub page for the latest version CDN script.</em></p>\n<p><code><a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js</a></code></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;You may also wish to include Alpine via NPM, which you can learn how to do from the Alpine Github repo.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Creating some example components,</em></strong></p>\n<p>Creating the first Alpine component is super simple.

Frontend first</strong></em></p>\n<p>Mastering client side (frontend) before server side (backend) is a good strategy. You will see your actions getting manifested in real time on the browser. This will keep you motivated to build more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>2. Fundamentals</strong></em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s VERY important to know the fundamentals of any framework by heart. If you claim to know the deeper intricacies of a framework and are unsure about the basics, then you need to revisit your learnings and probably also learning style. In a coding interview, this will be seen in a SUPER negative light. You&#8217;d want to avoid that.</p>\n<p><em><strong>3. 5 hours of JS and 5 years of JS</strong></em></p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know JavaScript yet, then it will take you a few hours to know it enough to get started with basic web development. However, to understand the subtle nuances of JavaScript, it will take years of practice. Get ready for this kind of a commitment.</p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Basic web security is mandatory</strong></em></p>\n<p>Fundamental knowledge about web security is expected from a fullstack dev. You should know the core of cryptography, HTTPS, application security, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Firewalls, SSH, etc.</p>\n<p><em><strong>5. SQL is as important as NoSQL</strong></em><!--more--></p>\n<p>Do not think NoSQL is better than SQL or vice versa. Know when to use which database. To be a good fullstack dev, you should know both.</p>\n<p><em><strong>6. Side projects</strong></em></p>\n<p>The best way to learn is by doing it. Try to build about 10 side projects. Add them to your portfolio. Cloning already existing services is a good way to learn. It will save you a lot of planning time. You can create a YouTube / TikTok / Instagram clone.</p>\n<p><em><strong>7. Host them projects</strong></em></p>\n<p>A rookie mistake you could make is to not host your project. Make sure you host it. Heroku is a good place to start. If your project isn&#8217;t hosted, its as good as never made.</p>\n<p><em><strong>8. CI/CD will make you stand out </strong></em></p>\n<p>To shine in a tech interview, make sure you know your CI/CD well. Have a structured GitHub repository and ensure CI/CD is working properly. Have proper unit tests in place. This will not only prove your competency in CI/CD but also show that you ship quality code and nothing else.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to CI/CD, I&#8217;d recommend you to check out GitHub actions to create a CI/CD pipeline.</p>\n<p><em><strong>9. Basic DevOps is mandatory</strong></em></p>\n<p>Nginx, load balancing, docker, caching is expected. There are no two thoughts about it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that people who are truly in love with computer science have a knack for DevOps. 😉</p>\n<p><em><strong>10. Get comfortable with cloud ☁️</strong></em></p>\n<p>If you are a cloud virgin, it can be daunting at first. But cloud is an acquired taste. Once you get into the groove, you will fall in love with it.</p>\n<p>Check out the services offered. If they fit well with your project, consider integrating them. They will fetch you brownie points.</p>\n<p><em>Source: Niharika Singh / dev.to</em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.
